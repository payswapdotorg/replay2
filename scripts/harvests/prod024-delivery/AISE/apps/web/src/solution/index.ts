/**
 * PROD-024 — the interactive solution workspace module, public API.
 *
 * `apps/web/src/solution/` is a SELF-CONTAINED workspace module (the
 * work order's mount contract §4.1): the Tech Lead mounts the single
 * `SolutionWorkspace` React component at the integration station (a
 * route/pane in the app shell) with the case/solution context, the agent
 * session handle and the optional service/BOQ bindings as props — no
 * global singletons, no module side effects, no edits outside this path.
 *
 * ONE OPERATION SEMANTICS (§4.2): every manipulation — direct
 * manipulation, timeline action, fallback action or confirmed agent
 * proposal — produces the same typed `EngineeringOperationIntent` objects
 * (the contract's single constructor surface) and flows through the ONE
 * engine submission path (`submitIntent` of operations.ts) into the
 * deterministic solution engine. The UI renders engine-computed states
 * only. OBSERVED reality stays read-only; PROPOSED layers can never
 * overwrite it (§4.3).
 *
 * The exports below are the mount surface + the seams the Lead wires:
 * the service port (engine), the agent port (the PROD-023 compiler) and
 * the guarded BOQ sync input. Everything else is module-internal.
