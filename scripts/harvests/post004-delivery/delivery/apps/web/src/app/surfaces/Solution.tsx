/**
 * PROD-026/PROD-031 — the INTERACTIVE SOLUTION surface: the integration
 * station of the interactive engineering solution workflow (the
 * composition layer's mount of the PROD-024 workspace).
 *
 * THE MOUNT CONTRACT (§4.1 of the PROD-024 work order, wired here): the
 * single `SolutionWorkspace` React component mounted at the project-scoped
 * route `#/projects/:id/solution` with the case/solution context (the
 * module's committed demo wall world — read-only through its public
 * fixtures), the engine service binding, the deterministic clock and the
 * guarded BOQ seam input (the recorded reference journey's generated trace
 * set). No workspace internal is duplicated or re-implemented here — this
 * surface composes, mounts and routes.
 *
 * THE SELECTION LADDER (PROD-031 — one more rung on the PROD-026
 * lazy-mount law): the mounted body is chosen by TWO cached dynamic
 * imports, each inside the SAME Suspense boundary, each logging its
 * outcome to the console's non-blocking channel (never a crash, never a
 * silent catch):
 *
 *  1. the LOCAL ENGINE MOUNT (`solution-mount.tsx`) — where the module
 *     graph evaluates (the server-side renders, the deterministic test
 *     gate, a future polyfilled build): the FULL composed surface with the
 *     workspace over the in-process engine and the journey record computed
 *     LIVE. In a plain browser the chunk's externalized node:crypto stub
 *     throws at the journey's createHash call — the cached promise
 *     resolves to null and the ladder falls through;
 *  2. the BROWSER MOUNT (`solution-browser-mount.tsx`, PROD-031) — the
 *     crypto-free twin: the workspace over the HTTP service binding (the
 *     engine executes server-side through the live same-origin routes,
 *     the baseline overlay included) and the committed journey record;
 *  3. the honest engine-unavailable composition — the problem, the
 *     observed facts, the recorded links; never a crash, never fabricated
 *     engine output.
 *
 * The agent seam: both mounted rungs bind the LIVE HTTP solution-agent
 * port (PROD-031 — the workspace's agent prop); the degraded composition
 * has no agent (the honest panel).
