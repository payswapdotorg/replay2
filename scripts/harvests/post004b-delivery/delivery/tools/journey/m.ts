/**
 * PROD-033 — the M journey (mobile/Android): the field journey, honestly.
 *
 * The M record is built on the PROD-032 E2B station's committed field
 * journey: the 16 steps with their existing honest classification (5 REAL
 * including the backend-boot and wire-envelope steps; 8 DETERMINISTIC;
 * 2 SYNTHETIC; 1 UNAVAILABLE-ON-STATION — imuActive=false never
 * conflated with supported), and the emulator lane's BLOCKED_NO_KVM
 * verdict.
 *
 * HONESTY LAW (binding): if an E2B sandbox is available (an E2B_API_KEY
 * in the environment) a fresh station run MAY be recorded (transcripts
 * committed under runs/m-e2b/); if NOT available, the M record cites the
 * COMMITTED PROD-032 transcripts at their recorded SHA — and says so
 * VERBATIM. A fresh run that was not performed is never claimed. In this
 * repository's recording environment E2B_API_KEY is NOT set, so the M
 * journey records the committed-transcript citation.
 *
 * The emulator limitation is recorded as its own step row with class
 * `physical` and status `FAIL→BLOCKED_NO_KVM` (the honest BLOCKED state,
 * exactly as PROD-032 recorded it) — never silently dropped, never
 * upgraded, and (per the harness's documented exit-code law) not a
 * harness failure: a recorded BLOCKED state is the expected honest
 * outcome of the emulator lane on a KVM-less station.
