/**
 * PROD-033 — the production journey harness: the evidence classes and the
 * run-record format.
 *
 * EVIDENCE DOCTRINE (binding, mirrors the work order):
 *
 *  - Every journey step record carries PASS/FAIL plus an evidence class
 *    drawn from EXACTLY {deterministic, synthetic, emulated, physical}.
 *    The class names the EVIDENCE SOURCE; a parenthesized qualifier names
 *    the EXECUTION MODE (live Chromium vs deterministic fallback). A class
 *    is NEVER upgraded: a synthetic byte is never recorded as physical,
 *    an emulated transcript is never recorded as a fresh live run.
 *  - A claim without a committed artifact behind it (a test name, a
 *    harness output file, or a committed transcript) is not evidence.
 *  - "It looked right" is not evidence: every PASS line cites its proof.
 *  - The final deployed-SHA proof belongs to the Lead's finalization
 *    (PROD-015); where this harness's evidence sits at a different SHA
 *    than any deployment, the record says so VERBATIM.
 *
 * LIVE-BROWSER HONESTY (binding): the W harness is BUILT for a real
 * headless Chromium (the tools/deployed-check.ts doctrine). Where Chromium
 * is unavailable, the harness still ships complete and the recorded run
 * falls back to the deterministic legs — the record states EXACTLY which
 * legs ran live and which fell back, in the per-step Class column. A live
 * run is never fabricated and console-error counts are never faked.
 *
 * Exit-code law (run.ts): exit 0 iff every step PASSes; any plain FAIL
 * step or any harness crash exits 1 with the failing step named. The one
 * recorded exception is the M journey's emulator row: its status is
 * `FAIL→BLOCKED_NO_KVM` — the honest BLOCKED state exactly as PROD-032
 * recorded it (recorded, never dropped, never upgraded, and NOT a harness
 * failure: the BLOCKED state is the expected honest outcome of the
 * emulator lane on a KVM-less station).
